        <h2>Racialized risk in clinical care: Clinician vigilance and patient responsibility</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6298860/" target="newwww">Medical Anthropology<br>Vol 38, No. 3, 2019</a><p>Racial/ethnic identity is contingent and arbitrary, yet it is commonly used to evaluate disease risk and treatment response. Drawing on open-ended interviews with patients and clinicians in two US clinics, we explore how racialized risk is conceptualized and how it impacts patient care and experience. We found that racial/ethnic risk was a common but poorly defined construct for both patients and clinicians, who intermingled concepts of genetics, biology, behavior, and culture, while disregarding historical or structural context. We argue that racializing risk embodies social power in marked and unmarked bodies, reinforcing inequality along racial lines and undermining equitable health care.

        <h2>Medicaid reform, responsiblization policies, and the synergism of barriers to low-income health seeking</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/26256f0e7b1500d4097d91dd4638c895/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=47564" target="newwww">Human Organization<br>Vol. 76, No. 3, 2017</a><p>Many recent health reforms in the United States are imbued with neoliberal responsibilization rhetoric, which encourages individual responsibility and reduced dependency on the state. This ideology is evident in waiver-modified Medicaid expansion programs which include personal responsibility requirements such as increased cost sharing and behavioral incentive programs. In this article, we explore the limits of responsibilization rhetoric in the context of the lives of a group of Medicaid-qualified people in Michigan. We consider the health needs and challenges they face, how they view and respond to such notions of responsibility, and their access to healthy behavioral choices such as exercising, eating healthy foods, and seeing a doctor. We found that most already embraced a desire to take responsibility for their health, but due to the synergistic impact of a variety of barriers—notably unreliable and changing health insurance coverage, fluctuating low-wage employment, and limited access to health resources—healthy choices were often inaccessible to them. Rather than framing beneficiaries as being to blame for their own poor health, health policies would be more effective if they were designed to directly mitigate some of the social and structural factors which synergistically act as barriers to health seeking.

        <h2>Electronic health records and the disappearing patient</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6104392/" target="newwww">Medical Anthropology Quarterly<br>Vol 31, No. 3, 2017</a><p>With rapid consolidation of American medicine into large-scale corporations, corporate strategies are coming to the forefront in health care delivery, requiring a dramatic increase in the amount and detail of documentation, implemented through use of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are structured to prioritize the interests of a myriad of political and corporate stakeholders, resulting in a complex, multi-layered, and cumbersome health records system, largely not directly relevant to clinical care. Drawing on observations conducted in outpatient specialty clinics, we consider how EHRs prioritize institutional needs manifested as a long list of requisites that must be documented with each consultation. We argue that the EHR enforces the centrality of market principles in clinical medicine, redefining the clinician’s role to be less of a medical expert and more of an administrative bureaucrat, and transforming the patient into a digital entity with standardized conditions, treatments, and goals, without a personal narrative.

        <h2>“They treat you a different way:” Public insurance, stigma, and the challenge to quality health care</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11013-016-9513-8.pdf" target="newwww">Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry<br>Vol 41, No. 1, 2017</a><p>Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid Expansion programs are extending Medicaid eligibility and increasing access to care. However, stigma associated with public insurance coverage may importantly affect the nature and content of the health care beneficiaries receive. In this paper, we examine the health care stigma experiences described by a group of low-income public insurance beneficiaries. They perceive stigma as manifest in poor quality care and negative interpersonal interactions in the health care setting. Using an intersectional approach, we found that the stigma of public insurance was compounded with other sources of stigma including socioeconomic status, race, gender, and illness status. Experiences of stigma had important implications for how subjects evaluated the quality of care, their decisions impacting continuity of care, and their reported ability to access health care. We argue that stigma challenges the quality of provided under public insurance and is thus a public addressed in Medicaid policy.

        <h2>Corporate logic in clinical care: the case of diabetes management</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/maq.12533" target="newwww">Medical Anthropology Quarterly<br>Vol 33, No. 4, 2019</a><p>As large corporations come to dominate U.S. health care, clinical medicine is increasingly market-driven and governed by business principles. We examine ways in which health insurers and health care systems are transforming the goals and means of clinical practice. Based on ethnographic research of diabetes management in a large health care system, we argue that together these organizations redefine clinical care in terms that prioritize financial goals and managerial logics, above the needs of individual patients. We demonstrate how emphasis on quality metrics reduces clinical work to quantifiable outcomes, redefining diabetes management to be the pursuit of narrowly defined goal numbers, despite often serious health consequences of treatment. As corporate employees, clinicians are compelled to pursue goal numbers by the heavy emphasis payers and health systems place on quality metrics, and accessing the required medications becomes the central focus of clinical practice.

        <h2>Collection of Nitrate in a Denuder</h2>
        <div class="container2">
          <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154459316.pdf" target="newwww">Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One+ Two<br>Vol 1, No. 1, 2008</a><p>Data are given for aerosol nitrate (NO3-) size distributions in the atmosphere as recorded by a cascade impactor and by an annular denuder. Using this data, our goal is to find the percent of nitrate in the atmosphere that the denuder is able to detect. This requires that we find the size distribution of nitrate that enters the denuder. From these data and calculations, we find that 32.8% of nitrate in the atmosphere can be detected by the denuder. Nitrate was measured to study its affects on seagrass in the Tampa Bay and to compare nitrate levels with seagrass growth and decline. Using a denuder for routine measurements will not allow scientists to accurately compare nitrate data to seagrass levels.
