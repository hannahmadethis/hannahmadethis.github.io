          I created a game called "Where is this dish from?" It is built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Players are given an image of a famous or common food dish from around the world, and a list of ingredients. They guess where they think the dish is from, and receive a correct/incorrect answer. The answer also provides some information about the dish. The "about" page includes source links for all images, as well as example recipes for the dishes.<p>This game is intended to be both fun and educational. It is color-coded for accessibility and maximum impact of learning.</p>
